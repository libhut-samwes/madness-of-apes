# The Madness Of Crowded Apes

This is a web app for demonstrating the power of urbit.media and other
urbit-related technologies.  For more information on urbit please visit
http://www.urbit.org.  The legacy internet portal to urbit.media is
http://urbit.media.

This project has grown out of the Cryptocurrency Forum I've hosted since autumn
2020 or so, originally on ~libhut-samwes but lately on ~sonwet.  The goal is
educational, entertainment, non-financial advice.
